# Visualising LCDS MetaData

A place to visualise metadata on LCDS publications.

* `./src/` is a place to hold code. The majority of the legwork is done by the helper `.py' files`, which are called into the `./src/main.ipynb` notebook.
* `./data/` holds our raw publications.xlsx file (thanks Bradley!) and also data returned from OpenAlex. It's split into `./data/raw/` and `./data/scientometrics`. It also contains information which we wrangle, which may be useful for reports or otherwise.
* `./figures/` is a place to store the output figures produced by calls within the notebook.
